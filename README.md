# NC-News - Front end app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This website was a project I completed while on the Northcoders Bootcamp. 
It is a news website that enables users to log in, filter through articles, comment, and vote on articles.

Please see the package.json file  to see a full list of all the dependencies used.
